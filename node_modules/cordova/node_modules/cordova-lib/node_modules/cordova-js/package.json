It should come pre-installed with [npm](http://npmjs.org) - but if you install node and can't run `npm` then head over to the website and install it yourself. Make sure you have all of the node dependencies installed by running the following command from the repository root:\n\n    npm install\n\nAll of the build tasks can be run via the `grunt` node module. Install it globally first by running:\n\n    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\n\nThen from the repository root run:\n\n    grunt\n\t\nFor integration, see the 'Integration' section below.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- On Windows, when you run `npm install`, you may get errors regarding\n  contextify. This is necessary for running the tests. Make sure you\n  are running node v0.6.15 at the least (and npm v1.1.16 which should\n  come bundled with node 0.6.15). Also, install [Python 2.7.x](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.3) and [Visual C++ 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express). When that is done, run `npm install` again and it should build\n  contextify natively on Windows.\n\n# How It Works\n\nThe `tasks/lib/packager.js` tool is a node.js script that concatenates all of the core Cordova plugins in this repository into a `cordova.<platform>.js` file under the `pkg/` folder. It also wraps the plugins with a RequireJS-compatible module syntax that works in both browser and node environments. We end up with a cordova.js file that wraps each Cordova plugin into its own module.\n\nCordova defines a `channel` module under `src/common/channel.js`, which is a publish/subscribe implementation that the project uses for event management.\n\nThe Cordova native-to-webview bridge is initialized in `src/scripts/bootstrap.js`. This file attaches the `boot` function to the `channel.onNativeReady` event - fired by native with a call to:\n\n    cordova.require('cordova/channel).onNativeReady.fire()\n\nThe `boot` method does all the work.  First, it grabs the common platform definition (under `src/common/common.js`) and injects all of the objects defined there onto `window` and other global namespaces. Next, it grabs all of the platform-specific object definitions (as defined under `src/<platform>/platform.js`) and overrides those onto `window`. Finally, it calls the platform-specific `initialize` function (located in the platform definition). At this point, Cordova is fully initialized and ready to roll. Last thing we do is wait for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to fire to make sure the page has loaded properly. Once that is done, Cordova fires the `deviceready` event where you can safely attach functions that consume the Cordova APIs.\n\n# Testing\n\nTests run in node or the browser. To run the tests in node:\n    \n    grunt test\n\nTo run them in the browser:\n\n    grunt btest\n\nFinal testing should always be done with the [Mobile Spec test application](https://github.com/apache/cordova-mobile-spec).\n\n# Integration\n\n## Cordova\n\nBuild the js files by running grunt as described above. Update each platform independently. For a given platform:\n\nReplace the cordova.js file in the cordova <platform>platform_www/cordova.js directory with the newly generated cordova.js file. If necessary, change the name of the new file to match that of the overwritten one.\n\nOnce the new js file has been added, any new projects created will use the updated js. To update an already existing project, directly replace the cordova.js file within the project's www/ folder with the generated cordova.PLATFORM.js. Make sure to change the file name to match the original.\n\n# Adding a New Platform\n\n1. Add your platform as a directory under the `src` folder.\n2. Write a module that encapsulates your platform's `exec` method and\n   call it exec.js. The `exec` method is a JavaScript function\n   that enables communication from the platform's JavaScript environment\n   into the platform's native environment. Each platform uses a different\n   mechanism to enable this bridge. We recommend you check out the other\n   platform `exec` definitions for inspiration. Drop this into the\n   `src/<platform>` folder you created in step 1. The `exec` method has the following method\n   signature: `function(success, fail, service, action, args)`, with the\n   following parameters:\n  - `success`: a success function callback\n  - `fail`: a failure function callback\n  - `service`: a string identifier that the platform can resolve to a\n    native class\n  - `action`: a string identifier that the platform can resolve to a\n    specific method inside the class pointed to by `service`\n  - `args`: an array of parameters to pass to the native method invoked\n    by the `exec` call\n   It is required that new platform additions be as consistent as\n   possible with the existing `service` and `action` labels.\n2. Define your platform definition object and name it platform.js. Drop this into the `src/<platform>` folder. This file should contain a JSON object with the following properties:\n    - `id`: a string representing the platform. This should be the same\n      name the .js file has\n    - `objects`: the property names defined as children of this property\n      are injected into `window`, and also *overrides any existing\n      properties*. Each property can have the following\n      child properties:\n      - `path`: a string representing the module ID that will define\n        this object. For example, the file `lib/plugin/accelerometer.js`\n        can be accessed as `\"cordova/plugin/accelerometer\"`. More details on how\n        the module IDs are defined are above under the \"How It Works\" section.\n      - `children`: in a recursive fashion, can have `path` and\n        `children` properties of its own that are defined as children of\n        the parent property object\n    - `merges`: similar to the above `objects` property, this one will\n      not clobber existing objects, instead it will recursively merge\n      this object into the specific target\n    - `initialize`: a function that fires immediately after the `objects` (see above) are defined in the global scope\n   \n   The following is a simple example of a platform definition:\n\n    <pre>\n    {\n      id:\"atari\",\n      initialize:function(){\n        console.log('firing up Cordova in my Atari, yo.');\n      },\n      objects:{\n        cordova:{\n          path:\"cordova\",\n          children:{\n            joystick:{\n              path:\"cordova/plugin/atari/joystick\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    </pre>\n\n3. You should probably add a `<platform>:{}` entry to the `Gruntfile` compile arrays.\n4. Make sure your native implementation executes the following JavaScript once all of the native side is initialized and ready: `require('cordova/channel').onNativeReady.fire()`.\n5. The deviceready event is important. To make sure that the stock\n   common JavaScript fires this event off, the device and network\n   connection plugins must successfully be instantiated and return\n   information about the connectivity and device information. The\n   success callbacks for these plugins should include calls to\n   `require('cordova/channel').onCordovaInfoReady.fire()` (for device\n   information) and\n   `require('cordova/channel').OnCordovaConnectionReady.fire()` (for\n   network information).\n6. Last but certainly not least: add yourself to the contributors list!\n   It's in the `package.json` file in the root of this repository. You\n   deserve it!\n",
