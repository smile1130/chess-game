It's useful for cases where you may need to\nexecute an action after multiple Signals are dispatched. It was split into its'\nown repository since this feature isn't always needed and that way it can be\neasily distributed trough npm.\n\n[CompoundSignal repository](https://github.com/millermedeiros/CompoundSignal)\n\n\n\n## Repository Structure ##\n\n### Folder Structure ###\n\n    dev       ->  development files\n    |- build       ->  files used on the build process\n    |- src         ->  source files\n    |- tests       ->  unit tests\n    dist      ->  distribution files\n    |- docs        ->  documentation\n\n### Branches ###\n\n    master      ->  always contain code from the latest stable version\n    release-**  ->  code canditate for the next stable version (alpha/beta)\n    develop     ->  main development branch (nightly)\n    **other**   ->  features/hotfixes/experimental, probably non-stable code\n\n\n## Building your own ##\n\nThis project uses [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) for the build process. If for some reason you need to build a custom version of JS-Signals install Ant and run:\n\n    ant build\n\nThis will delete all JS files inside the `dist` folder, merge/update/compress source files, validate generated code using [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) and copy the output to the `dist` folder.\n\nThere is also another ant task that runs the build task and generate\ndocumentation (used before each deploy):\n\n    ant deploy\n\n**IMPORTANT:** `dist` folder always contain the latest version, regular users should **not** need to run build task.\n",
