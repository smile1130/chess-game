  "readme": "**Knockout** is a JavaScript [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML. It uses *observers* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of *declarative bindings* to enable productive development.\r\n\r\n##Getting started\r\n\r\n**Totally new to Knockout?** The most fun place to start is the [online interactive tutorials](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see\r\n\r\n * Documentation on [the project's website](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)\r\n * Online examples at [http://knockoutjs.com/examples/](http://knockoutjs.com/examples/)\r\n\r\n##Downloading Knockout\r\n\r\nYou can [download released versions of Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/) from the project's website.\r\n\r\nFor Node.js developers, Knockout is also available from [npm](https://npmjs.org/) - just run `npm install knockout`.\r\n\r\n##Building Knockout from sources\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to build the library yourself:\r\n\r\n 1. **Clone the repo from GitHub**\r\n\r\n        git clone https://github.com/knockout/knockout.git\r\n        cd knockout\r\n\r\n 2. **Acquire build dependencies.** Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your workstation. This is only needed to _build_ Knockout from sources. Knockout itself has no dependency on Node.js once it is built (it works with any server technology or none). Now run:\r\n\r\n        npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n        npm install\r\n\r\n    The first `npm` command sets up the popular [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) build tool. You might need to run this command with `sudo` if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, or in an Administrator command prompt on Windows. The second `npm` command fetches the remaining build dependencies.\r\n\r\n 3. **Run the build tool**\r\n\r\n        grunt\r\n\r\n    Now you'll find the built files in `build/output/`.\r\n\r\n## Running the tests\r\n\r\nIf you have [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) installed, then the `grunt` script will automatically run the specification suite and report its results.\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to run the specs in a browser (e.g., for debugging), simply open `spec/runner.html` in your browser.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMIT license - [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n",
